     <div  class="row d-flex justify-content-center">
   <div  class="col-12"><p style="font-family: Ibaara Real Nova, serif" id="about-content">Hey hey hey! My name is Cavetta, and welcome to Life With Vetta. I am a mom to 2 amazing boys. Kal-El 16 And Jor-El 11. I have been divorced and a single mom for a few years now. Juggling raising the men of tomorrow, working, having a life outside of my boys (nonexistent). We LOVE to travel. I originally moved from Jamaica to California for college. The travel bug had bitten me and the need to see the world and what it has to offer has always been with me. I went on a few cruises before kids, traveled to different states and cities, exploring and wandering. 
    <br>
<br> 
     When I found myself with 2 kids, alone I knew one of my first goals was to show them the world and let them see things outside of their comfort zone. We took our first cruise when they were itsy bitsy and had a blast. Since then, we traveled the states, city hopping and seeing their home country. We then trotted over to London and Paris when they were older and that struck a chord and lit a fire that was not going to be tamed by anything but travel and adventure. I had been thinking and considering being a digital nomad.
<br>
<br>

I have always worked online from home. The biggest reason being I wanted to be home for the kids. Be able to go to teacher conferences, field trips, and more. I wanted to do it all. Work, be a stay-at-home to be able to do it all. And it has been working for me. I have 2 degrees and currently do not use them. I could be in the corporate world making bank but I am content living and doing what I am doing how I am doing it. But I had the itch to travel and see more, do more. I talked with the kids asking how they would feel if we traveled while they virtual schooled. They were more excited than on Christmas morning. 
     <br>
<br>
     
     We were supposed to leave in 2020, then corona hit. And they switched to virtual school. This was the test to see how they would fear. Could they manage? 
The youngest has maintained his Principal's honor roll status of straight Aâ€™s and the oldest, well, he says as long as he has a passing grade. Believe me 2 kids and 2 different scholars lol. But he has been passing all his classes and maintaining his AB average. Both kids were very eager to leave traditional school though they would miss their friends. They do still keep in touch with face time, discord, and social media. I knew once we started traveling they would not be without friends or acquaintances. They would meet new people and possibly develop lifelong friendships and experiences that would remain with them for all time. So we took off. 
<br>
<br>

We have so many adventures planned, the known and unknown and we are ready to embrace it all. The good, the not so good, and the wth. Come along with us on this journey. Come experience Life With Vetta. Living life with intention.</p> </div>
